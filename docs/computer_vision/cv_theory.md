## B. Introduction
- Basic ConvNet consist of [Convolutional layer](#b-convolutional-layer), [Pooling Layer](#c-pooling-layer), and [Fully-Connected Layer](#e-fully-connected-layer)
- Each layer accepts a 3d volume and transforms it to an output 3d volume via a functional layer 

---
## C. Convolutional Layer
- Image data does not fit well to regular NNets due to high dimensionality of the data (e.g. 32x32x32 colour image = 32\*32\*32 = 3072 weights)
- Convolutions dont
